Description: In non-experimental studies, causality should not be 
    avoided. Associations are a poor proxy for causal effects if 
    they are not properly adjusted for common causes. However, 
    it is still possible to ask how large bias due to unadjusted 
    common causes can be in support of a causal claim. The bias 
    in a standardised mean difference (d) depends on how strongly 
    the common predisposition, a summary of factors not considered, 
    is related to the factor (convertible into several other effect 
    size measures) and the outcome (scalable as correlation). 
    Actually, the left boundary of the confidence interval for d 
    must exceed the product of these two relations. We present 
    ViSe, an R package and Shiny application that helps to 
    visually constrain these quantities and shows which combinations 
    of the quantities support a causal effect. Such visual sensitivity 
    analysis can be conducted on any published results, or on simple 
    summary or the t-statistics.
